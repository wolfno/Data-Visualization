<br> </br>
**Goals:**
* Gaining hands-on experience with **Tableau Desktop**
* Creating valuable graphs for my GitHub portfolio
* Creating insights from official government data

<br> </br>
**Main findings:**
* Higher education leads to higher income
* People in cities earn less than they could expect in rural areas
* Age is not a statistically significant predictor of income

<br></br>
**Tools and Data:**
* Tableau Desktop
* Income Tax Statistics (official government data, public)
